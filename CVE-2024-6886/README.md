# CVE-2024-6886: Stored XSS in Gitea

A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gitea 1.22.0 and earlier may allow a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the web browser of a victim by injecting a malicious payload into
the repository description.


## Proof of Concept

- Log in to the application.
- Create a new repository or modify an existing repository by clicking the Settings button from from the `/$username/$repo_name/settings` endpoint.
- In the `Description` field, input the following payload:

    `<a href=javascript:alert()>Hello there!</a>`

- Save the changes.
- Upon clicking the repository description, the payload was successfully injected in the Description field. By clicking on the message, an alert box will appear, indicating the execution of the injected script.
